There is no point in saying that medicine plays an important role in the lives of all people.
The fact that good health is more important than good medicine cannot be denied without doubt. 
However, what is to do if you suddenly came down with a serious disease.
For example you caught somewhere the flu or you caught the broqitis.
When the doctor saw me, he was shocked. Pale appearance, red jaw, bunged up nose, slurred speech and a high temperature.
I didnâ€™t argue with him, but once and for all I vowed to never ignore a visit to the doctor.
